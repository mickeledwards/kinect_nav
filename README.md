# Kinect Driven Mirroring Sculpture
openCV + openKinect pairing together to eventually move sculptural pieces in reaction to the kinect

## Hardware Used

Currently, I'm using a Kinect V1 feeding data into a Raspberry Pi 3verB that controls four [Adafruit Servo HATs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2327)

These are connecting to an array of 64 [SG90 servos](http://www.towerpro.com.tw/product/sg90-7/)
